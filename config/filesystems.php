        | who is looking.
        |
        | The split used to BE the access-control decision — a file's folder
        | decided whether the world could read it, and a file written to the
        | wrong one was public with no way to take it back. Access is decided in
        | code now, so the two disks only have to agree on where bytes live.
        |
        | Both are kept as names so the ~100 existing `disk('public')` call
        | sites keep working; they are the same disk.
